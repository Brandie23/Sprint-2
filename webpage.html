         What did I learn from the book?
        </h3>
        <p> 
            It introduced me to the different concepts such as mindfullness, engineering empathy and some of the
            tools for relaxation and removing any inherent bias I may have.

          Two minutes of mindfullness
      </h3>
      <p>
          The two minutes of mindfullness was, useful as a tool to calm my mind and clear my thoughts. It also helped me
           lower my heart rate and in turn improve my mindset and ability to think/solve problems.
